    Clean, centroid, and normalize a spectrum with the following steps:

        1. Remove empty peaks (m/z <= 0 or intensity <= 0).
        2. Remove peaks with m/z >= max_mz or m/z < min_mz.
        3. Centroid the spectrum by merging peaks within min_ms2_difference_in_da.
        4. Remove peaks with intensity < noise_threshold * max_intensity.
        5. Keep only the top max_peak_num peaks.
        6. Normalize the intensity to sum to 1.


    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : np.ndarray in shape (n_peaks, 2), dtype=np.float32 or list[list[float, float]]
        A 2D array of shape (n_peaks, 2) where the first column is m/z and the second column is intensity.

    min_mz : float, optional
        The minimum m/z to keep. Defaults to None, which will skip removing peaks with m/z < min_mz.

    max_mz : float, optional
        The maximum m/z to keep. Defaults to None, which will skip removing peaks with m/z >= max_mz.

    noise_threshold : float, optional
        The minimum intensity to keep. Defaults to 0.01, which will remove peaks with intensity < 0.01 * max_intensity.

    min_ms2_difference_in_da : float, optional
        The minimum m/z difference between two peaks in the resulting spectrum. Defaults to 0.05, which will merge peaks within 0.05 Da. If a negative value is given, the min_ms2_difference_in_ppm will be used instead.

    min_ms2_difference_in_ppm : float, optional
        The minimum m/z difference between two peaks in the resulting spectrum. Defaults to -1, which will use the min_ms2_difference_in_da instead. If a negative value is given, the min_ms2_difference_in_da will be used instead.
        ** Note either min_ms2_difference_in_da or min_ms2_difference_in_ppm must be positive. If both are positive, min_ms2_difference_in_ppm will be used. **

    max_peak_num : int, optional
        The maximum number of peaks to keep. Defaults to None, which will keep all peaks.

    normalize_intensity : bool, optional
        Whether to normalize the intensity to sum to 1. Defaults to True. If False, the intensity will be kept as is.

    **kwargs : optional
        Those keyword arguments will be ignored.
